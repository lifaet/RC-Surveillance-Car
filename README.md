# Remote-Control-Car
The aim of this project is to design and build a remote controlled surveillance camera car using a ESP32 module, car kit, Motor driver module. This car can be controlled remotely using a smartphone or a computer via Wi-Fi, and it can stream live video from its onboard camera to the user’s device. The project involves designing the circuit, assembling the hardware, programming the ESP32 cam module, and creating a user interface for the surveillance camera car. This surveillance camera car can be controlled by any web browser via Wi-Fi getaway and can stream live video feed to the web getaway. The camera car can also perform various functions such as turning, accelerating, braking, and capturing photos or videos. The project demonstrates the potential of the ESP32 cam module for creating fun and useful projects that can be used for surveillance, exploration, or entertainment. Also, I have a plan to demonstrates something new in the printed circuit board world. The project can be further improved by adding more features such as obstacle avoidance, voice control, gesture control or even auto pilot.
This project can have some real life uses in various fields and scenarios, such as:
•	Security and surveillance: The camera car can be used to monitor and inspect areas that are dangerous, inaccessible, or sensitive, such as military bases, crime scenes, disaster zones, or wildlife habitats. It can also be used to detect and deter intruders or trespassers.
•	Education and entertainment: The camera car can be used to teach and learn about robotics, programming, electronics, and physics. It can also be used to have fun and explore new places with a first-person view.
•	Research and development: The camera car can be used to test and improve new technologies and algorithms related to wireless communication, image processing, autonomous driving, obstacle avoidance, etc.
•	Media and journalism: The camera car can be used to capture and broadcast high-quality images or videos of events, landscapes, or phenomena that are otherwise difficult or risky to access by human reporters or photographers.

# Expected Result
This project is expected to result in a camera car that can be controlled remotely using a smartphone or a computer via Wi-Fi. The camera car can stream live video from its onboard camera to the user’s device and move up, down, left, and right using two SG90 servo motors. It can also move forward, backward, left, and right using four DC motors controlled by an L298N motor driver module. The project involves assembling the hardware, programming the ESP32 cam module, and creating a web server that displays a video streaming of what the camera sees and some buttons to control the camera and the car. The expected result is a fun and useful project that can be used for surveillance, exploration, or entertainment.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this project is about building a remote controlled camera car using the ESP32-CAM module, which is a low-cost and low-power microcontroller with an integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity and a camera sensor. The project involves programming the ESP32-CAM using Arduino IDE, connecting it to a motor driver and a car chassis, and streaming video from its camera. The project also involves creating a web server that can control the camera car remotely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project can be used for various purposes such as fun, surveillance, security, learning, or research. The project helps to learn about robotics, computer vision, wireless communication, and artificial intelligence.
